What is Hash Code?
Google’s team-based programming competition, Hash Code, allows you to share your skills and connect with other coders as you work together to solve a problem modeled off a real Google engineering challenge! In small teams of two to four, coders all over the world will tackle the first problem through Qualification Round. Though this round is hosted online, teams can come together virtually to compete side-by-side in locally coordinated Hash Code Hubs. The top teams from this round are invited to join us for the virtual World Finals.
How it works
This is our online platform where you’ll form your team, join a Hub, practice, and compete during the rounds. During the Qualification Round, you’ll watch our YouTube livestream to be introduced to the problem, and your team will have four hours to solve an optimization problem using the programming language and tools of your choice. Teams can also compete alongside other teams in your area by joining a virtual Hub. The top teams from the Qualification Round will be invited to the virtual World Finals, where they’ll work together to solve another challenge and compete for cash prizes.
